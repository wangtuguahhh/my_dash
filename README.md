# my_spacex_project_dash
For the SpaceX Falcon 9 project, some interactive charts are generated using Plotly Dash.

📙 Juper-Dash is used [in the Python script](https://github.com/wangtuguahhh/my_spacex_project_dash/blob/b3002ebe354c9d502a7f7f5da3337a1a1499462c/my_spacex_jupyter_dash.ipynb).

📚 Data:
Data are from IBM Data Science training program.
[Download training data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/spacex_launch_dash.csv)

🎉 The dashboard includes:
* Successful Landing Rate by Launch Site
  - User can compare successful landing rate among different launch sites
  - From drop-down bar, user can check successful landing rate of one launch site of interest
* Correlation between Landing Outcome and Payload Mass with Booster Version
  - From drop-down bar, user can check the correlation for one launch site of interest
  - A slider is available for user to select a range of Payload Mass
 
⏳ Future work:
* To deploy the dash app to a website if having more time

📸 Screen shots of the dashboard:
* From the 2nd screen shot, for large payload mass rockets, > 5500 Kg, KSC struggled to achieve successful landing.
